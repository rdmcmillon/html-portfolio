  <p>My interest in Web Development started when i was very young. Today my accomplishment in this area is a lifelong dream.</p>
    
   <p>I am a wife, mother of 2 boys who each have their own families, Grandma of 3, and Nana of 5. My husband and I are retired. We love the outdoors
   (camping and fishing topping the list). We both consider ourselves displaced Montanans even though we are now living in California. My husband is
    an avid hunter more for the meat than the trophy. We enjoy the snow but the cold seems to become more noticable the older we get.</p> 
    
    <p>The smell of pine trees, seeing a field of alfalfa, hearing a stream or creek babbling, or seeing the cotton from the cotton wood trees flying 
    through the air will remind us of the good ol' days. We love horses, and although we aren't riding anymore, we still enjoy watching them run
    and kick up their heels! </p> 

    <p>My husband is an avid fan of the USC Trojans, Los Angeles Dodgers, and NASCARS. He gets so excited when watching a game or race that I usually take 
    our dog with me into another room.  To me, a little football, or baseball, or racing goes a long ways.
